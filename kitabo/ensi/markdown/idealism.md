Absolutely, Ned Stark from "Game of Thrones" embodies the `archetype` of the idealist thrust into a world where such ideals are often seen as weaknesses. His unwavering sense of honor and justice, traits that made him a beloved and respected leader in the North, became his downfall when he entered the treacherous political landscape of King's Landing. His tragedy lies in his inability to adapt to the ruthless machinations of the court. Ned's insistence on adhering to his principles, despite the evident danger, highlights his naiveté. In a world where deception and betrayal are the currency of power, Ned Stark's rigid adherence to honor rendered him tragically out of place, ultimately leading to his demise.
